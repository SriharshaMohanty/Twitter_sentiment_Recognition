# Twitter_sentiment_Recognition
Sentiment analysis is the process of automatically detecting whether a text segment
contains emotional or opinionated content, and it can furthermore determine the
text’s polarity.One of the most popular microblogs is Twitter, which was launched
in 2006 and since then has attracted a large number of users. Currently, Twitter has
666 million active users who post 500 million tweets per day.Due to the fact that it
provides an easy way to access and download published posts,twitter is considered
one of the largest datasets of user generated content. Twitter sentiment
classification aims to classify the sentiment polarity of a tweet as positive or
negative.
Sentiment analysis is a prevalent application of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and a popular area of research in data science currently. From conducting
surveys to developing comprehensive marketing plans, this field has drastically
altered the approach businesses take, making it essential for every data scientist to
understand. Processing thousands of text documents for sentiment and other
features like named entities, topics, and themes can be done within seconds, a task
that would take a team of individuals hours to complete manually.
In this project report, we have discovered how to tackle the Twitter Sentiment
Analysis Problem.
OBJECTIVE:
Twitter sentiment Analysis - Problem Statement
In this report, we have presented an NLP Twitter sentiment analysis model
that helps to overcome the challenge of sentiment classification of tweets. We
will divide the tweets into positive and negative emotions.
The dataset provided is the Sentiment Dataset with 7920 tweets extracted via
Twitter API python library TWEEPY . The characters in this Twitter database are:
● Label: The polarity of the tweet (positive(0) or negative(1)).
● Ids: The unique id of the tweet
● Tweets :Displays the Text from tweets
